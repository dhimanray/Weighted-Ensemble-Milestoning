# Weighted Ensemble Milestoning (WEM)

Weighted Ensemble Milestoning is python package based on WESTPA Toolkit. It is intended for performing Weighted Ensemle (WE) simulation in conjunction with Milestoning. I am building this as a part of my PhD project with Prof. Ioan Andricioaei at UC Irvine.

This is being tested for a 1D Potential (Directory: 1d-double-well) and on Alanine dipeptide. Details will be updated as work goes on.
