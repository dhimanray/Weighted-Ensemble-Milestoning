# Weighted Ensemble Milestoning (WEM)

Weighted Ensemble Milestoning is python package based on WESTPA Toolkit. It is intended for performing Weighted Ensemle (WE) simulation in conjunction with Milestoning. I am building this as a part of my PhD project with Prof. Ioan Andricioaei at UC Irvine.

This is being tested for a 1D Potential (Directory: 1d-double-well), (10+1)D Coupled potential (Directory: 11d-double-well) and on Alanine dipeptide. 

Calculations have been perfeormed for simple langevin or MD, regular WE and WE combined with milestoning for all cases. In case of 1d regular milestoning calculations were also performed.
